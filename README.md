## Installation

Installation can be done either from the precompiled package or directly from source. The easiest way is to use the package.

After installation, make sure to edit the `Checkout/Completed.cshtml` view so that the Klarna confirmation snippet is shown.

```csharp
@Html.Action("ConfirmationSnippet", "KlarnaCheckout", new { orderId = Model.OrderId })
```

### From Package

1. Download zip from the [release](https://github.com/Motillo/klarna-checkout-nopcommerce/releases) page.
2. Unzip the content into the `Plugins` folder.
3. Install and configure the plugin through nopCommerce's administration interface.

### From Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Make a link from the cloned `src` directory to the `Plugins` folder in your nop project.  
    1. Open a command prompt (admin privileges might be required)
    2. Type: `mklink /J C:\Path\To\nop\Project\Plugins\Motillo.Nop.Plugin.KlarnaCheckout C:\Path\To\Cloned\klarna-checkout-nopcommerce\src`
3. Within the solution, right click the `Plugins` folder and add a reference to the existing project.
4. Rebuild solution.
5. Install and configure the plugin through nopCommerce's administration interface.

After making changes to the plugin, make sure you rebuild the project. Every time the plugin is rebuilt, necessary content is copied to `Presentation/Nop.Web/Plugins`.

## Important Notes

This plugin was created for a specific case where the Klarna Checkout snippet is rendered *directly* inside the payment info area,
which means that the customer won't be redirected to a specific payment page. Therefor nop's ordinary "Complete Payment" button needs to be
disabled/hidden when using the plugin, since Klarna has its own "Complete Payment" button. Otherwise you will end up with an unpaid order.

This plugin is inspired by [Klarna Checkout by Majako](https://github.com/martingust/klarna-checkout-nopcommerce).
